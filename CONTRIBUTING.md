# CL Helper
## Creating Issues
1. Go to https://github.com/smurphy917/cl_helper/issues
2. Login in, or create an account if necessary
3. Click 'New Issue'
4. Provide a relevant title
5. In the body of the issue, please provide the following:
    1. __Version of the program that you are running - this is *very* important__
    1. Context of the issue--was the program running already, if so how long? were you running multiple accounts or just one? etc.
    2. Exact steps that you had just taken before seeing the issue--did you click a specific button? Were you adding a new user, and what exactly did you click on and enter?
    3. Detailed description of the issue--include any errors that you see or any other details you can provide. Phrases such as "It didn't work" or "It stopped" are not helpful as they provide no description of what actually happened. 
    4. Attach any relevant files--this could include screenshots (push the 'PrtScrn' button on your keyboard, then paste into the issue body) or log files, as an example. 
6. For now, click the send logs button in the program at or near the same time as you create the issue. I can map the time I receive the logs to the time the issue is created (In the future, I may come up with a better method than this).
7. Post the issue. You should receive email updates (at the email address used for your GitHub account) for any activity on the issue. This may include requests for more information from me, or notification that the defect is fixed. Please note that just beuase the issue is marked resolved, it doesn't mean that an updated version of the program with the fix is released yet. There will be a delay between the issue being fixed and a new version being released with the fix.
